**Author:** Kian KKK  
**Date:** July 2025  
**Tool:** IBM SPSS Statistics  
**Dataset:** IBM HR Analytics ‚Äì Employee Attrition & Performance

---

## Project Overview

This project investigates key factors that influence **employee attrition, satisfaction, and salary**, using a real-world HR dataset.  
All analyses were conducted using **IBM SPSS Statistics**, combining statistical reasoning with practical HR insights.

The project addresses the following core questions:
- What variables best predict employee attrition?
- How does satisfaction relate to retention or income?
- Are salary differences significant across marital or academic fields?
- Can we model the psychological and structural pathways behind attrition?

## Analysis Summary

### 1. Attrition Modeling
- **Monthly Income** and **Stock Options** are strong predictors (*p* < 0.001).
- Model accuracy was 83.3%, but failed to detect actual leavers due to class imbalance.

### 2. Relationship Satisfaction & Attrition
- Borderline significance (*p* = 0.054).
- Interpersonal satisfaction may affect turnover mildly.

### 3. Correlation with Total Working Years
- Weak negative correlation (r = ‚Äì.182, *p* < .001).
- Employees with more experience are slightly more stable.

### 4. Factor Analysis: Education, Training, Experience
- One factor extracted (FAC1_1), but with weak internal consistency (Œ± = 0.036).
- Logistic regression significant (*p* < .001) but not useful in classification.

### 5. Job Involvement by Field of Study
- ANOVA results: no significant difference (*p* = 0.943).
- Mean job involvement scores were similar across fields.

### 6. Salary Differences by Marital Status
- Significant difference between **single vs married** employees (*p* = 0.018).
- Married employees earned ~$688 more on average.

### 7. Path Analysis: Satisfaction ‚Üí Income
- Model:  
  `RelationshipSatisfaction, EnvironmentSatisfaction, JobLevel ‚Üí JobSatisfaction ‚Üí MonthlyIncome`
- None of the paths were statistically significant.
- Suggests income is likely driven by structural factors.

## Key Takeaways

- **Financial incentives** matter more than emotional or perceptual satisfaction in attrition.
- Predictive models need **balanced data** for accuracy.
- Not all workplace factors translate to behavioral change (e.g., satisfaction ‚â† income).
- Combining statistical modeling with HR insight reveals powerful relationships.
